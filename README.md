> Lookup information given an username.

## [DEMO]()

Currently this app only searches for an user's possible email address given a GitHub username.

Due to lack of GitHub authentication, you should hit your rate limit after using the app for a short while.

## Development

- `npm run dev`
- Open `localhost:4000` with your favorite browser

## Production

- `npm run prod`
- Serve `index.html` and `/dist` with your favorite static asset server
